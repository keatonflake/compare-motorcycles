# Compare Motorcycles
### A dynamic web application designed to allow users to compare different motorcycles by their specs and get a A.I summary of the selected motorcycles.

## Why
I love motorcycles and thought I would combine that with my desire to gain an appreciation for state management without using any frameworks or libraries. 
I was intentionally not using newer tools to have strong understanding of the pros and cons of a dynamic website that only renders and stores data on the client side.

## Key Features
- Motorcycle Database Integration: Utilizes an API to fetch detailed data about various motorcycles
- Google Gemini Integration: Implements JavaScript classes to create visually appealing motorcycle cards with relevant details
- Custom Card Generation Implements JavaScript classes to create visually appealing motorcycle cards with relevant details
- Local Storage: Stores user-selected motorcycle data in local storage to ensure persistence across sessions

**This project will always be special to me because of how much I learned. The benefits of state management with modern libraries and frameworks are amazing.**

## Challenges
There were so many challenges with updating or removing data and making sure it updated on the D.O.M that I left excited to build more projects using the latest tools.
